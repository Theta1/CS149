#### Teamwork
Be sure you are a member of the Inception team of the Theta1 organization, here https://github.com/orgs/Theta1/teams/inception this provides admin controls for merging rebasing so that we can all verify eachother's work and bring it into the master

#### Branching / Merging Strategy
To reduce chance of merging catastrophe, we're going to use some form of branching
and merging strategy. Here's how we can do it:

- Each project member creates a branch named after them.
- Each project member does work on their respective branch.
- Every time someone wants to merge back to master, create a pull request from this page: https://github.com/Theta1/CS149/pulls Do after issue is complete.
- 2nd Someone will then review the pull request and merge them if satisfactory. 
- Each project member needs to rebase frequently from master to their own branch to make sure their branch 
is up-to-date.
